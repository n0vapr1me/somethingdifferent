							<h3>About me</h3>
							<p>
 <p> I went to California State University Northridge (CSUN), with a degree in BioTechnology. Before I decided to try and get my masters to do medical research, I wanted to see if patient care was something I might like to do in the future rather than research. Quite a few of my peers are in the technology field so when I was referred to thinkful I wanted to see what opportunities are shown from there.</p>
